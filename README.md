This repository holds a work-in-process implementation of
[OpenID Federation](https://openid.github.io/federation/main.html) in the `go` language with the goal to enable go applications to make 
use of OpenID federations.

The implementation mainly focuses on the Relying Party and Intermediate / Trust Anchor side, but not on the OP side. However, building blocks can also be utilized for OPs or other entity types.
We provide a basic library as well as a configurable and flexible fedentity to support higher level functionality. This serves as a base for our examples.
The [examples](https://github.com/zachmann/go-oidfed/tree/master/examples) directory contains example 
implementations for a [Relying Party](https://github.com/zachmann/go-oidfed/tree/master/examples/rp) and an 
[Intermediate Authority / Trust Anchor / Trust Mark Issuer](https://github.com/zachmann/go-oidfed/tree/master/examples/ta). Those serve 
as examples on how the oidfed 
library and the fedentity can be used to implement such entities;
they can be used as they are for proof of concepts;
for production usage it is strongly recommended to tweak it to your needs.

Please also refer to the README in the examples directories for further details.

### Implementation State

The library is not considered stable and some features might be missing. We encourage everybody to give feedback on 
things that are missing, not working, or weird, also suggestions for improvements and of course we are open for pull 
requests.

We try to be up-to-date with the latest version of the spec, but this might not
always be the case.


Here we try to sum up the current implementation state, (but it's very likely
that the list is not complete)
